# Dr. Antoine Pietri

## About me

I am a Backend Software Engineer living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. I work at
Google's ZÃ¼rich office, where my focus is on building large graph databases
applied to privacy systems. In 2021, I completed my Ph.D. in Paris, France,
where I conducted research on large-scale analysis of the graph of public
software development. In 2016, I obtained a MSc in theoretical computer
science, majoring in machine learning.

I am also passionate about economics, particularly environmental economics and
climate change research.

You can find my **[resume here](cv/cv.pdf)**.

## Research

### Software Heritage

My PhD was conducted as part of the [Software
Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) project at
[Inria](https://www.inria.fr/) under the supervision of my PhD advisor,
[Stefano Zacchiroli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Zacchiroli).
My research was focused on making accessible for research the *graph of public
software development*, an immense interconnected graph of more than 25 billion
software artifacts, linked together by more than 450 billion edges.

You can find the thesis here:

    Large-Scale Mining**, *PhD thesis. 2021.*

### Vcsn

I was previously working as a Research Student on the C++ finite state
machine framework [Vcsn](https://www.lrde.epita.fr/wiki/Vcsn) in the
[LRDE](https://www.lrde.epita.fr) laboratory, under the supervision of
[Akim Demaille](https://www.lrde.epita.fr/wiki/User:Akim) and with help
from [Jacques Sakarovitch](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~jsaka/),
where I worked on:

-   2014: finding short [synchronizing
    words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronizing_word):
    [slides](https://koin.fr/upload/pietri.14.seminar.slides.pdf) ---
    [report](https://koin.fr/upload/pietri.14.seminar.techreport.pdf)
-   2015: efficient elimination of spontaneous transitions in weighted
    automata
-   2016: random generation of automata

## Volunteering

### Citizen's Climate Lobby

I'm a strong advocate for evidence-based policies for climate change
mitigation. There is an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence that *carbon
pricing* is an efficient and fair solution to abate greenhouse gas emissions,
and that adverse effects on low-income households can be considerably reduced
or eliminated through a *carbon dividend redistribution scheme*.

I volunteer with [Citizen's Climate Lobby
Europe](https://citizensclimateeurope.org/) to advocate for this solution. I
went several times to the European Parliament where I met with MEPs to explain
this scheme, which eventually ended up being integrated to the EU ETS2 policy
(Social Climate Fund).

### Girls Can Code

In 2014, I co-founded [Girls Can Code!](https://girlscancode.fr/) with
Jill-JÃªnn Vie and Marin Hannache, a summer camp for high-school girls, with the
goal to promote gender diversity in computer science. We were granted the
Google RISE award ($20000) as a way to kickstart the initiative, which is still
running today.

### Prologin

I have been an organizer of the French national programming contest
**[Prologin](https://prologin.org)** from 2011 to 2021. I was the president of
the organization in 2014, and after that mostly focused on the technical
aspects of the contest.

I worked on a lot of very interesting projects there, among which:

-   [camisole](https://github.com/prologin/camisole): a secure sandbox
    in Python that uses kernel namespacing and cgroups
-   [stechec2](https://github.com/prologin/stechec2): a client-server
    match-maker and networking framework in C++
-   [sadm](https://github.com/prologin/sadm): the full infrastructure of the
    finals, where I wrote a [custom task
    queue](https://github.com/prologin/sadm/tree/master/python-lib/prologin/masternode)
    with Python and asyncio, an
    [RPC](https://github.com/prologin/sadm/tree/master/python-lib/prologin/rpc),
    and many other backend/infrastructure tools and services.
-   [prologin.org](https://github.com/prologin/prologin-site): the website in
    Django.

I wrote algorithmic exercises and written subjects for the contest. You
can find the most interesting ones here (in French):

-   [Repli](https://prologin.org/train/2014/qualification/repli)
    (shortest synchronizing word)
-   [Relaxation](https://prologin.org/train/2012/qualification/relaxation)
    (change-making problem)
-   [Couplage](https://prologin.org/train/2014/semifinal/couplage)
    (longest common subsequence problem)
-   [Correction de
    copies](https://prologin.org/train/2014/semifinal/correction)
    (partition problem)
-   [Marelle](https://prologin.org/train/2012/semifinal/marelle)
    (dynamic programming)
-   [Many whelps! Now handle
    it!](https://prologin.org/static/archives/2017/demi-finales/sujet/manywhelps.pdf)
    (bin-packing)
-   [Glabulzateurs](https://prologin.org/static/archives/2014/demi-finales/sujet/glabulzateurs.pdf)
    (automata theory)
-   [The Time
    War](https://prologin.org/static/archives/2012/demi-finales/sujet/time-war.pdf)
    (path finding and dynamic programming)

I also created the tournament games of the finals in
[2013](https://prologin.org/static/archives/2013/finale/sujet/island-quest.pdf),
[2014](https://prologin.org/static/archives/2014/finale/sujet/tours-de-magie.pdf),
[2015](https://prologin.org/static/archives/2015/finale/sujet/noosphere.pdf)
and
[2016](https://prologin.org/static/archives/2016/finale/sujet/provogon.pdf).

## Projects

I have many contributions in various open source projects, most of which can be
found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/seirl).

### Personal projects

-   [SimpleArmory](https://github.com/kevinclement/SimpleArmory): a website to
    track collections in World of Warcraft, with data-mining of the game
    files to generate the collections. Tens of thousands of daily active users.
-   [epiquote](https://github.com/seirl/epiquote): a bash.org-like
    website in django
